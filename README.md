# E-Commerce Back-End

  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mit-blue.svg)
  
  
## Description
I created this application to become more familiar with back-end functionality. I increased my understanding of Sequelize so that I can use JavaScript to write back-end code in mySQL. I was able to join tables in the database and write GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
